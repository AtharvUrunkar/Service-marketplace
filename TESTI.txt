I have reached the FULL-STACK TESTING STAGE of my Vendor Management System.

Context:
- This is a vendor marketplace system (user → vendor after admin approval).
- Backend is already implemented and running locally.
- Frontend is implemented and connected to backend.
- Roles exist: USER, VENDOR, ADMIN.
- Core flows: user registration, vendor application, admin approval, vendor dashboard, service creation.

What I want from you:
- Give me EXACT, STEP-BY-STEP instructions to set up LOCAL AUTOMATED TESTING.
- Cover ALL layers:
  1. Backend unit tests
  2. Backend integration tests (API + DB)
  3. API automation (end-to-end flow)
  4. Frontend UI automation
- Use INDUSTRY-STANDARD tools only.
- Assume I want ONE-COMMAND execution for all tests.
- Provide:
  - Folder structure
  - Tool choices
  - Example test cases (real ones, not dummy)
  - Common mistakes to avoid
- Do NOT explain theory. Treat me like a developer shipping to production.
- If assumptions are needed, state them clearly and proceed.

Now give me the instructions.
